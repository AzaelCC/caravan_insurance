# caravan_insurance
I explore the caravan policy data set and create a classification model to predict good candidates for marketing campaings.

Main tools:
* Experiment tracking: MLFlow
* Classification algorithms: Random forest, Logistic Regression
* Feature selection: Chi-squared, R-squared
* Data visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib

To reproduce this repository, please install the adecuate libraries either with enviroment.yml if you use conda or with requirements.txt otherwise.

While this is mainly an exploration and experimentation repository it was made with reproducibility and tracking in mind. This way is easier to make a product out of our machine learing models learned here. You can refer to **this** other repo for an example on how to productionize our findings and models.
